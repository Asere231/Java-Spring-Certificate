# Java-Spring-Certificate Projects

This repository contains all my Java projects completed as part of a Java Certification course.  
Each folder represents a separate project, demonstrating key concepts and skills in Java programming.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

- **QUIZ_CONSOLE_APP**  
  A very simple console-based quiz application ‚Äî the first project in this course. It showcases the basics of Java programming, including object-oriented design, class creation, arrays, and user input using `Scanner`.  
  The program asks the user a series of multiple-choice questions, records their answers, and prints a score at the end. It's designed to reinforce fundamental Java concepts in a practical and interactive way.

- **DemoJDBC**  
  A standalone project built in IntelliJ to learn the fundamentals of **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**.  
  It demonstrates how to connect to a PostgreSQL database, run queries, insert records using `PreparedStatement`, and properly manage database resources.  
  The focus is on learning the basic steps: loading the driver, establishing a connection, executing SQL, and closing resources.

- **HibernateDemo**  
  A separate IntelliJ project designed to learn **Hibernate**, a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework.  
  This project includes examples using annotated entity classes like `Laptop`, `Alien`, and `Student`.  
  It covers configuration via `hibernate.cfg.xml` and `hibernate.properties`, session management, and how to perform CRUD operations using Hibernate's Session API.  
  Emphasis is placed on separating configuration from code for secure credential handling and scalable design.

- **SpringDemo**  
  A basic Spring project that introduces **Java-based configuration** using `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, and dependency injection through setters.  
  It demonstrates how to wire custom beans (`Alien`, `Laptop`, `Desktop`) using interfaces like `Computer`, and manage their interactions via Spring's ApplicationContext.  
  This project avoids component scanning and instead uses manual bean registration to reinforce foundational Spring IoC concepts.  
  Logs such as "Laptop created" and "Compiling..." help visualize bean instantiation and method execution.

- **SpringBootDemo**  
  A transition project from **SpringDemo** to **Spring Boot**, this application introduces Spring Boot's auto-configuration and simplified setup using `@SpringBootApplication`.  
  It demonstrates how to register beans like `Laptop`, `Desktop`, and `CPU` using `@Component` and how to inject dependencies automatically into the `Alien` class using `@Autowired`.  
  The project eliminates the need for manual configuration files (`@Configuration`, `@Bean`) and instead leverages component scanning and Spring Boot‚Äôs convention-over-configuration approach.  
  It serves as a foundation for building modern Spring Boot applications with clean code, better structure, and minimal boilerplate.

- **SpringJDBC**  
  A Spring Boot project focused on using **Spring JDBC** to perform database operations in a clean and layered architecture.  
  The project demonstrates how to connect to a PostgreSQL database using Spring Boot‚Äôs `application.properties`, load schema and data using `schema.sql` and `data.sql`, and define service and repository layers (`StudentService`, `StudentRepo`) to manage student records.  
  It uses `JdbcTemplate` for querying the database and maps results to Java objects like `Student`.  
  Environment-sensitive configuration (e.g. DB credentials) can be separated from Git-tracked files using a `local` profile or environment variables to ensure secure development practices.  
  This project serves as a hands-on introduction to working with relational databases in Spring Boot without using JPA or Hibernate.

- **JobApp**  
  A full-stack **Spring MVC web application** for managing job postings. It features dynamic JSP pages (`addjob.jsp`, `viewalljobs.jsp`, `success.jsp`, `home.jsp`) styled with custom CSS and Bootstrap, and uses Spring's MVC architecture to handle form input, business logic, and view rendering.  
  The application includes:
  
  - A `JobPost` model that holds job profile data including title, description, required experience, and tech stack
  - A `JobController` to handle web requests and bind user-submitted form data
  - A `JobService` for business logic
  - A `JobRepo` (in-memory) to simulate persistent storage

  Form submissions are processed via POST, and the resulting job posts are displayed using JSTL with `c:forEach` tags. View logic is separated cleanly, and CSS files (`style.css`, `style1.css`) apply consistent styling across the site.  
  The project demonstrates classic Spring MVC flow with JSP views, making it a solid bridge before transitioning to more modern frontend integrations or REST-based APIs.

- **SpringBootRest**  
  A RESTful Spring Boot application that exposes API endpoints for managing job postings using **Spring Data JPA** for persistence.  
  This project demonstrates a clean controller-service-repository architecture with a focus on real database integration.

  Key components:
  - `JobPost` is annotated with `@Entity` and mapped to a database table
  - `JobRepo` extends `JpaRepository`, enabling full CRUD capabilities and custom query support
  - `JobService` contains the business logic and interacts with the repository layer
  - `JobRestController` exposes REST endpoints for clients to interact with job data via HTTP

  The project uses standard JPA annotations and Spring Boot auto-configuration to manage entity persistence.  
  Functionality was tested using **Postman**, which confirmed that all REST endpoints (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) operate correctly with data being stored in a persistent relational database.

  This project evolved from a version that stored job data in-memory to a more robust, scalable design using Spring Data JPA ‚Äî a concept learned and applied from the `SpringDataJpa` project.

- **SpringDataJpa**  
  A Spring Boot project demonstrating the use of **Spring Data JPA** to perform database operations with minimal boilerplate code.  
  This project uses a `Student` entity and a `StudentRepo` interface that extends `JpaRepository`, enabling powerful CRUD and query operations without writing SQL.  
  The application connects to a relational database using standard Spring Boot configuration and automatically maps the `Student` object to a table using JPA annotations.

  Key highlights:
  - Uses `@Entity`, `@Id`, and `@GeneratedValue` in `Student.java` to define a persistent model
  - Leverages Spring Data JPA's dynamic query method naming (e.g., `findByAgeGreaterThan()`, `findByNameContaining()`)
  - Includes a clean `SpringDataJpaApplication` class to bootstrap the app and demonstrate repository usage
  - Can be tested using Postman or the command line runner for interacting with the repository at startup

  This project focuses on how Spring simplifies data access with JPA and is ideal for mastering entity-repository interaction in enterprise-grade applications.

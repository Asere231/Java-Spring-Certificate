This repository contains all my Java projects completed as part of a Java Certification course.  
Each folder represents a separate project, demonstrating key concepts and skills in Java programming.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

- **QUIZ_CONSOLE_APP**  
  A basic console-based quiz application written in Java. This project showcases the use of classes, constructors, arrays, user input handling with `Scanner`, and simple logic for evaluating user responses.  
  The program prompts the user with multiple-choice questions, collects their answers, and calculates a final score based on correct responses. It's a great demonstration of control flow, object-oriented design, and Java fundamentals.

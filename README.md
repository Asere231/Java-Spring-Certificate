- **QUIZ_CONSOLE_APP**  
  A very simple console-based quiz application ‚Äî the first project in this course. It showcases the basics of Java programming, including object-oriented design, class creation, arrays, and user input using `Scanner`.  
  The program asks the user a series of multiple-choice questions, records their answers, and prints a score at the end. It's designed to reinforce fundamental Java concepts in a practical and interactive way.

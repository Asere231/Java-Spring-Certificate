# Java-Spring-Certificate Projects

This repository contains all my Java projects completed as part of a Java Certification course.  
Each folder represents a separate project, demonstrating key concepts and skills in Java programming.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

- **QUIZ_CONSOLE_APP**  
  A very simple console-based quiz application ‚Äî the first project in this course. It showcases the basics of Java programming, including object-oriented design, class creation, arrays, and user input using `Scanner`.  
  The program asks the user a series of multiple-choice questions, records their answers, and prints a score at the end. It's designed to reinforce fundamental Java concepts in a practical and interactive way.

- **DemoJDBC**  
  A standalone project built in IntelliJ to learn the fundamentals of **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**.  
  It demonstrates how to connect to a PostgreSQL database, run queries, insert records using `PreparedStatement`, and properly manage database resources.  
  The focus is on learning the basic steps: loading the driver, establishing a connection, executing SQL, and closing resources.

- **HibernateDemo**  
  A separate IntelliJ project designed to learn **Hibernate**, a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework.  
  This project includes examples using annotated entity classes like `Laptop`, `Alien`, and `Student`.  
  It covers configuration via `hibernate.cfg.xml` and `hibernate.properties`, session management, and how to perform CRUD operations using Hibernate's Session API.  
  Emphasis is placed on separating configuration from code for secure credential handling and scalable design.
